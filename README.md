This app was built using the how-to YouTube provided by Web Dev Simplified @ https://youtu.be/hEtZ040fsD8?si=gDmxOTIA3YKvXw0b 

All credit is owed to the developer, content creator, and owner of the YouTube channel Web Dev Simplified.

# Development

This app is being developed using React JavaScript. However, it will be converted to a React Typescript app once completed and functional.

Other than building the app while following along with the video, my only contribution will be the conversion to Typescript to use as a refernce point for a project app with similar functionality.
